Rain Fair Code License v1.1.4 (RFCL) (DRAFT – General Use)

1. Purpose
The Rain Fair Code License is designed to promote fair, ethical, and transparent use of software. It allows for use in both open and closed-source projects, while protecting the rights of developers and the values of human dignity.

2. Permissions
You are allowed to:
- Use, modify, and distribute this code, including in commercial and closed-source applications
- Use the code in public or private projects
- Patent your own inventions, as long as you comply with this license

3. Conditions
You must:

- Give clear attribution to the original author.
- Include the line:
  - “Made using source code from [Original Author’s Name or Project Name].”
- Link to the original code in your documentation or about page.
- Clearly state modifications in closed-source projects:
  - Summarize added, changed, or removed features
  - Note if any files were added or deleted

This attribution must appear in publicly visible documentation, such as a README, 'About' section, or software credits.
This does **not** require open-sourcing your code.

Not claim endorsement:
You may not imply that the original author supports, approves, or is affiliated with your project, unless explicitly stated.

4. Ethical Restrictions
You may **not** use this software for:

- Military purposes or weapons development
- Mass surveillance, tracking, or behavioral profiling
- Intelligence or law enforcement operations that violate civil rights
- Censorship or suppression of free expression (except where clearly and transparently required by democratic law)
- Detaining individuals without due process of law
- Human trafficking, abuse, or exploitation of any kind
- Discrimination against people based on race, religion, gender, sexuality, disability, or other protected characteristics
- Any activity that intentionally causes harm to individuals or communities
- Use by companies or organizations that require employees or contractors to work hours that violate local labor laws — including excessive or forced overtime (commonly known as “996” schedules)

Violation of this section automatically terminates your rights under this license.

5. Termination
Your rights under this license terminate automatically if you violate its terms, including Sections 3 or 4.
Upon termination, you must immediately stop using, distributing, or modifying the software.
Continued use after termination is considered copyright infringement and may be subject to legal enforcement.
Use of the software in violation of this license may also constitute copyright infringement under applicable law.

6. Patent Grant & Retaliation
By using this software, you receive a royalty-free license to any patents held by the original author that are essential to using the code.

However, if you initiate a patent lawsuit against anyone for using this software or derivative works, your rights under this license are revoked.

7. Warranty Disclaimer
This software is provided “as is”, without warranty of any kind.
The original author is not liable for any damages, losses, or misuse.

8. Trademark
This license does **not** grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or logos of the original author, except as required for attribution.
Any such use requires separate, explicit permission.

9. Using this License
This license may be reused by other developers for their own projects, provided that all references to the original author are updated accordingly.
To do so, replace [Original Author’s Name or Project Name] with your own.

This is the Rain Fair Code License — for developers who believe software should empower, not exploit.
