# Rain Fair Code License

An ethical software license that allows open and closed-source use with attribution and restrictions on harmful use.

## ‚ú® About This License

The Rain Fair Code License (RFCL) is designed to balance freedom and responsibility. It lets developers use, modify, and distribute code ‚Äî even in commercial or closed-source projects ‚Äî while enforcing ethical standards that protect human dignity.

Unlike many licenses that are either too restrictive or too permissive, RFCL aims to give developers **freedom with fairness**.

## ‚ù§Ô∏è Why I Created This License

Many existing licenses either limit freedom too much or give too much freedom without considering the ethical impact of software use. I created the Rain Fair Code License because I wanted a license that:

- Allows **open and closed-source use** without forcing code disclosure
- Requires **clear attribution** to respect original creators
- Prohibits use for **military, surveillance, or harmful purposes**
- Enforces consequences if the license is violated, protecting developers' rights and values

In short, I believe software should **empower people, not exploit them** ‚Äî and this license reflects that belief.
